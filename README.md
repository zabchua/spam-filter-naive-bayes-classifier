# spam-filter-naive-bayes-classifier
This is a Java program that takes in a text file filled with test data (spam and regular messages) and trains the Naive Bayes Classifier. Afterwards, tests if the filter works and outputs statistical data about its efficiency. This project was made with a partner @DreNisay
